## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Panel stays movable
The user SHALL be able to move the panel by dragging a visible area that is not the text. Every note window MUST show a drag area across its top edge and a bottom bar across its bottom edge. Both MUST span the full width of the window. The bottom bar MUST be 20% lower than the drag area. Both MUST show a shaded fill that sets them apart from the note area: darker than the note area in light appearance and lighter in dark appearance. The drag area MUST NOT show a grip mark. The drag area MUST show only its shaded fill, the "−" and trash buttons, and the Notely logo. The bottom bar of a note window MUST show only the Bold, Italic, and Underline buttons at its leading edge, and the font button, the text size button, and the tint button at its trailing edge. Dragging the drag area, or the bottom bar outside its buttons, MUST move the panel. The note area MUST end above the bottom bar, so no note text shows under it. Dragging inside the text MUST select text and MUST NOT move the panel.
